### Usage

1. **Define Your Slide Data**:
   Create an array of slide objects, with each object containing a `title` and `body`. Example:

   ```ts
   export const slides = [
     {
       title: "Introduction",
       body: "This is an example of dynamically generated content for a PowerPoint slide.",
     },
     {
       title: "Features",
       body: "- Dynamic generation\n- Customizable layouts\n- Automated downloads",
     },
   ];
   ```

2. **Use the `DownloadButton` Component**:
   Import the `DownloadButton` component and pass the slide data as a prop:

   ```tsx
   import DownloadButton from "@/components/DownloadButton";
   import { slides } from "@/data/slides";

   export default function App() {
     return (
       <div className="container">
         <h1>Dynamic PowerPoint Generator</h1>
         <DownloadButton slides={slides} />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Generate and Download the Presentation**:
   Click the "Download PPTX" button to generate and download the `.pptx` file.
